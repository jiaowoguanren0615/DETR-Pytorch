# DETR-Pytorch
## paper: https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/end-to-end-object-detection-with-transformers/

This code is mainly based on the PyTorch framework to reproduce the DETR model. Its initial implementation comes from the Meta Research code repository. It has been modified and extended to make it easily adaptable to your own dataset training and validation tasks. In addition, we have added a script to convert JSON files to XML annotation files in VOC format, which helps to better manage and use annotation data. Moreover, we also provide a convenient script to convert XML files to YOLO format TXT files.
